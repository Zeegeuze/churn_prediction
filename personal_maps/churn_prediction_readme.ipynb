    "## **Overview**\n",
    "This project implements a churn prediction model using **XGBoost** and **Random Forest** classifiers. It includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model training, and evaluation. The models are trained on a dataset of customer information and used to predict whether a customer will churn (Attrited) or stay (Existing)."
